## Synopsis

This project explain how to implement a REST API with Spray that has CORS support

## Assumptions

I assume you have experience and your working environment ready to work with the below technologies/frameworks:

Akka, SBT, CORS, Spray, cURL, Scala, Git

## Requisites

This post is oriented to these people who have experience working with Scala and are starting to work with Spray for REST API implementations.

## Motivation

* Learning to declare your own Spray directives

* Developing Rest API's that have CORS support

## Installation

The repository contains a couple of branches:

* no-cors: Obviously this branch does not have CORS support

* cors: This onw contains CORS support.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors
